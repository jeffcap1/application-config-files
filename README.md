# Application Setting And Configuration Files

This is meant to be a collection of different configuration files for a variety of applications.

These can then be synced and shared between systems. Since they are in a VCS experimentation can happen without fear
of breaking or losing configuration settings.

## List of Applications

- Bat
- Fastfetch
- iTerm2
- Starship
- Tmux
- ZSH

## General Setup

In general, symlink the files and folders to the `~/.config` directory to use them.

## ZSH

Instead of symlinking this to the `~/.config` directory, symlink this to the home directory (`~`) and call it `.zsh-config-settings`.
