# Application Setting/Config Files

This is meant to be a collection of different configuration files for a variety of applications.
These can then be synced and shared between systems. Since they are in a vcs experimentation can happen without fear
of breaking or losing configuration settings. These files/folders can then be symlinked where they need to be
for that application to register them.
